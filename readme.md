# Hungarian Algorithm for Optimal Assignment

The Hungarian algorithm is a combinatorial optimization algorithm that solves the assignment problem, determining the optimal assignment of tasks to agents with the minimum cost. This implementation uses the concepts of priming, starring, and covering to iteratively find the optimal assignment.

## Usage

```python
from hungarian_algorithm import optimal_assignment

# Example distance matrix
distance_matrix = [
    [5, 2, 8],
    [3, 7, 2],
    [6, 1, 4]
]

# Find optimal assignment
assignment = optimal_assignment(distance_matrix)

print("Optimal Assignment:", assignment)
```

## Functions

### `new_alternating_path(matrix, i, j)`

Finds a new alternating path in the matrix, altering the starred and primed zeros.

### `cover_zeros(matrix)`

Covers the zeros in the matrix using primed and starred zeros, marking rows and columns that are covered.

### `shift_zeros(matrix, marked_rows, marked_cols)`

Shifts the values in the matrix to create more zeros.

### `optimal_assignment(dist_matrix)`

Takes a distance matrix and returns the optimal assignment.
